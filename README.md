# MattAI (beta)
PREMISE: MattAI was originally trained in the Italian language.

This is a project that took me weeks of work, totally alone but always with the same determination. MattAI is an artificial intelligence based on the charRNN model. that unlike the GPT model, charRNN predicts the next character instead of the token. It was trained with books, python scripts, novels, normal sentences and dictionaries. 
All this to say that I have no degree or specialization in artificial intelligence, so I'm not an expert, just a curious guy who wants to get his hands dirty with fun projects. JUST A CURIOUS GUY.


LukeSecurity has always been curious, his biggest dreams are to always discover things almost far from the everyday world, even if their use can be useful in everyday use  like artificial intelligence, kernel developing, and all kinds of science. Since 2023 he has changed his life with the advent of programming by turning his curiosity. This is his first independent project.

# Requirements
For training MattAI was trained on an NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU and for inference (response generation) you will need an NVIDIA GPU.
