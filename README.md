# MattAI
This is a project that took me weeks of work, totally alone but always with the same determination. MattAI is an artificial intelligence based on the charRNN model. that unlike the GPT model, charRNN predicts the next character instead of the token. It was trained with books, python scripts, novels, normal sentences and dictionaries. 
All this to say that I have no degree or specialization in artificial intelligence, so I'm not an expert, just a curious guy who wants to get his hands dirty with fun projects. JUST A CURIOUS GUY.
This is his first independent project, and his first AI. Enjoy MattAI!
